  <h2 class="mt-0">5 Saturated Steady Flow at the Field Scale</h2>

  <p>
    On a field scale, hydraulic head can be measured using various types of wells (either installed separately, in a
    spatially clustered arrangement, or at the same horizontal location but at varying depths). Groundwater wells are
    essentially large-scale versions of the laboratory-scale piezometers used to illustrate Darcy’s law in preceding
    sections. The following presents the relationship of hydraulic head and flow in three basic formation types
    (confined aquifer, aquitard, unconfined aquifer) in the saturated zone, and Figure 19 provides a schematic overview.
  </p>

  <p>
    A <strong>confined aquifer</strong> is bounded above and below by an <em>aquitard</em>, a semi-pervious formation
    that restricts flow between overlying and/or underlying aquifers. Interpolation of water levels measured in wells
    screened in a confined aquifer defines the <strong>potentiometric surface</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    An <strong>unconfined aquifer</strong> is bounded only at its base by an aquitard. The top of the unconfined aquifer
    is the <strong>water table</strong>, which equals the observed water level in a screened well just deep enough to
    encounter standing water.

  <h3>5.1 Hydraulics of Flow in Confined Aquifers</h3>

  <p>
    The experimental setups used to illustrate head and flow resemble conditions in a confined aquifer, because low-K
    confining layers bound it. When those layers have much lower hydraulic conductivity than the aquifer, they behave
    nearly as no-flow boundaries (as in the earlier experiments), although under most natural conditions some cross-flow
    through aquitards can still occur where gradients exist (Darcy’s law).
  </p>

  <p>
    Central to confined systems is the <strong>potentiometric surface</strong>, an imaginary surface (Figure 20a)
    represented with equipotential contours in plan view (Figure 20b) and as a line in cross section (Figure 20c).
    Section 5.3 discusses aquitard effects in more detail.
