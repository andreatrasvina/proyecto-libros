In addition, Darcy’s law is independent of the orientation of the apparatus, because
flow occurs in the direction of the hydraulic gradient. For example, as shown in Figure 4,
the magnitude of the hydraulic gradient is the same in each case and the flow direction is
always parallel to the apparatus.

  <span class="font-bold">Figure 4</span> - also illustrates an important aspect regarding how we interpret hydraulic gradient measurements, and it is worth noting early on.

In the cases shown above, the gradient is defined with reference to ∆L, which is the distance between the measurements along the flow path. However, in practice, when we measure water levels in existing wells or install new wells to measure hydraulic gradient, we may not know the flow direction. In fact, flow direction is one of the most fundamental characteristics of groundwater we are trying to ascertain.

Consider the various cases shown in Figure 4. If we were unable to observe the orientation of the cylinder, all we could deduce from the head measurements is that there is some component of flow in the horizontal direction (towards the right). It is also possible that the flow could have an upward or downward component.

We can even imagine the case where the inclination of the cylinder is steeper than those shown, such that flow could be nearly vertical. This mental exercise highlights a critical consideration needed to interpret hydraulic head data to infer flow direction: we must have some knowledge or assumptions regarding other factors that affect flow.

In this case, it is the orientation of the confining boundaries (i.e., the sides of the cylinder). Such knowledge provides a framework upon which we can interpret the head data. Later in this book, we discuss additional factors related to the interpretation of water level elevations in wells, such as spatial variation of hydraulic conductivity and the location and type of recharge and discharge zones, because these must also be considered to properly interpret hydraulic head data.
