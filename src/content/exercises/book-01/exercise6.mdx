Example Problem 6 – Flow in an Unconfined Aquifer

a) Draw the water table.  
b) Draw the 70 m, 75 m, and 80 m equipotential contours and sketch several flow lines.

The figure below represents a cross-section of an unconfined aquifer that extends between two wells and a central river. The task is to identify the shape of the water table and how groundwater discharges toward the river. 
This problem demonstrates the relationship between hydraulic head and the geometry of the flow system.
