**Example Problem 6 – Flow in an Unconfined Aquifer**

a) Draw the water table.  
b) Draw the 70 m, 75 m, and 80 m equipotential contours and sketch several flow lines.

The figure below represents a cross-section of an unconfined aquifer that extends between two wells and a central river. The task is to identify the shape of the water table and how groundwater discharges toward the river. This problem demonstrates the relationship between hydraulic head and the geometry of the flow system.

### Interactividad

Puedes usar el siguiente módulo interactivo para dibujar la línea freática, las equipotenciales (70 m, 75 m, 80 m) y las líneas de flujo directamente sobre el esquema del acuífero.

import InteractiveWaterFlow from "../../../components/ejercicio-6/InteractiveWaterFlow.astro";

The figure below illustrates the solution to Example Problem 6. The water table slopes toward the river, showing discharge at the center, and equipotential contours are approximately perpendicular to the water table, indicating flow direction.
