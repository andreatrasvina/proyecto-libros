title: A Conceptual Overview of Surface and Near-Surface Brines and Evaporate Minerals
author: Warren W. Wood
description: Arid environments form in response to a combination of arid or semi-arid climate and a topography that results in the pervasive formation of brine and associated mineral deposits. The salts originate as dissolved solids in the rainfall and from the weathering of minerals as the rain infiltrates in the uplands and flows as groundwater to discharge in the lowlands where salt accumulates.

Waters with elevated concentrations of solutes occur on all continents in both deep geologic basins and at or near the surface. This book focuses on the conceptual understanding of the hydrogeology and geochemistry of surface and near-surface (less than 100 m depth) environments of elevated solute environments. These environments are important because they have significant impact on ecology, economics, and water resources and provide important clues and proxies to the paleogeomorphology, paleohydrology, and paleoclimate of the area.

In general, permeant-elevated solute conditions in shallow systems occur because of groundwater and/or river water discharged to topographically closed depressions in arid or semi-arid areas where the water is removed only by evaporation. Topographically closed basins cover approximately 18 percent of the continental surface (Hammer, 1986). Examples of such basins are the Caspian Sea in Eurasia, Great Salt Lake in North America, Lake Eyre in Australia, Lake Titicaca in South America, and Lake Chad in Africa, as well as hundreds of smaller closed basins. The obvious exceptions to this origin are salt seeps generated by the discharge of deep geologic brines to the surface; these can occur in any climatic environment.

Shallow saline environments have been given a variety of names including: sabkhat (plural for sabkha, and its variant spellings, in the Arabic-speaking world); salinas, salares, saladas, salars, and playas (in the Spanish-speaking world); and pans, saline lakes, alkali flats, salt plains, dry lakes, and salt flats (in the English-speaking world). Brine, saline, and brackish water are different expressions for water with solute concentrations greater than 1,000 mg/L. For the purposes of this book, water is classified as:

- slightly saline, where solute concentrations range from 1,000 to 3,000 mg/L;
- moderately saline, where solute concentrations range from 3,000 to 10,000 mg/L;
- highly saline, where solute concentrations range from 10,000 to 35,000 mg/L; and,
- brine, where solute concentrations are greater than seawater (35,000 mg/L).

Rainfall/evaporation ratio maps that identify extremely arid, arid, and semi-arid areas are a good first approximation of areas where shallow saline environments typically form (Figure 1).
